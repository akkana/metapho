	Update main and ImageViewer classes to use gi gtk3 explicitly,
	and to use cairo methods for checking window size.
	Improvements to the image viewer classes.
	 Add resize handling to the viewer to rescale the image
	when window size changes.
	Allow moving forward/back in image lists in the viewer window.
	Handle fullsize/unfullsize events, including resizing the containing
	window if it allows it; implement next/previous so you can have
	multiple images stored in the same zoomview.
