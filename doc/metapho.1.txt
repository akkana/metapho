       _m_e_t_a_p_h_o  lets  you tag large numbers of images as efficiently as possi‐
       ble.  Although it uses a graphical user interface, it's intended to  be
       controllable entirely through the keyboard.

       It  offers  two  modes,  somewhat  similar  to the vi editor.  Normally
       you're in "navigational" mode, where you can rapidly move between  pho‐
       tos  and  view  and  toggle  tags.  Clicking in a text entry, or typing
       Return or <Ctrl>Space, will let you add new tags. Hit ESC,  Return,  or
       <Ctrl>Space to leave entry mode and return to navigational mode.

       Tags  will  be written to a file named Tags.  Metapho tries to be smart
       about where to write the Tags file, using the highest common  directory
       of  the images passed to it on the command line. It will also read tags
       in from any Tags files that already exist in any of the image  directo‐
       ries,  and will save those tags (unless changed by the user) along with
       any new tags added.

       Metapho obeys the following keys:

       [[ssppaaccee]]
              Go to next image.

       [[bbaacckkssppaaccee]]
              Go to previous image

       rr, tt, [[rriigghhtt--aarrrrooww]]
              Rotate right (clockwise)

       RR, TT, ll, LL, [[lleefftt--aarrrrooww]]
              Rotate left (counter-clockwise)

       [[uupp--aarrrrooww]], [[ddoowwnn--aarrrrooww]]
              Rotate 180 degrees.

       HHoommee   Go back to the first image.

       EEnndd    Go to the last image.

       <<CCttrrll>>qq
              Quit the application, writing any changes to the Tags file.

       <<CCttrrll>>dd
              Delete this image file from disk.  This will bring up a  confir‐
              mation  dialog;  clicking  OK  or  typing  another  d or <Ctrl>d
              deletes the file.

       aa through zz or AA through ZZ
              Toggle the appropriate tag for this image.

       RReettuurrnn If in navigation mode: activate the first blank tag and let  you
              type  in  it.   If in entry mode: leave entry mode and return to
              navigation mode.

       <<CCttrrll>>SSppaaccee
              Stop typing in a tag field and move to the next  image;  or,  if
              not  currently  in  a tag field, activate the next tag and shift
              focus there.

       EEssccaappee Ensure focus is not in a text field,  so  any  characters  typed
              will be navigational.

       <<CCttrrll>>UU
              Forget  all tags for the current image.  By default, when moving
              from one image to a new image that has no tags yet, metapho will
              copy  the  tags  from  the  previous image.  Use <Ctrl>U to turn
              these off.

       //      Search for tags matching whatever you type.  Use Return  or  ESC
              to get out of search mode.
