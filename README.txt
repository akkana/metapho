metapho
=======

A keyboard-driven app for tagging and organizing large numbers of photos efficiently.

This arose out of my [Pho]
.. _Pho: http://shallowsky.com/software/pho/
image viewer ([Pho on GitHub](https://github.com/akkana/pho)).
It started to get unwieldy adding ever more tagging features to what
was intended as just a fast, light image viewer.

Metapho is intended as a fast, lightweight, flexible way of organizing
large numbers of photos. It uses flat files, not a proprietary database,
so you're not locked down to this one app, and you can view your
keywords databases at any time, or edit them in a text editor if
you should ever want to.

It's driven primarily from the keyboard: you should be able to do
everything you need without moving your hands to the mouse, though
there are some mouse operations for those who find them easier.

It depends on python-gtk, but not on gnome or any other desktop services.
