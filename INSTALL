INSTALLING PYTOPO

Install pytopo on your local machine with
    python setup.py install
(you'll need Python's setuptools package).

Or get it from PyPI:
    pip install pytopo

Install from the development directory to a virtualenv:
    pip install .

Either way, the executables will be called pytopo and ellie.
On its first run it will create the configuration file it needs.

Developers: To run from the development directory
    pip install -e .
or
    setup.py develop

HTML docs are generated with Sphinx following
https://samnicholls.net/2016/06/15/how-to-sphinx-readthedocs/

It needs the m2r extension, which isn't available on Debian/Ubuntu.
So you have to pip install sphinx-markdown sphinx m2r
(sphinx-markdown may not be strictly necessary, and you might also
need sphinx-autoapi).
It doesn't work to have m2r from pip but sphinx from distro packages;
then sphinx-build has /usr/bin/python3 hardwired in, and it won't
see your pip installed m2r.

To generate the HTML docs:
Make sure you have the m2r module installed, then:
    cd doc/sphinxdoc
    make html
